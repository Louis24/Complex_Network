# Complex_Network
1. Given several routes, reasonably determine the departure interval, reasonably allocate vehicles and personnel according to passenger flow demand, route level, service function and bus operation conditions.
2. Evaluate the accessibility of regional bus lines, analyze the number of areas that can be directly reached in the region, the number of areas that can be reached with one transfer, and analyze and find inconvenient travel areas, stations in the region, and the travel volume of residents.
3. Evaluate bus routes, establish a bus route index evaluation system from several aspects such as route technical level, route passenger level, operation service level and economic benefits, evaluate the current operating bus routes, identify the routes to be optimized and give optimization suggestions.
4. Based on the bus route station data and subway line station data, combined with complex network related algorithms, analyze the bus-subway composite network, including the determination of the buffer radius R, calculation of degree distribution, average path length, betweenness centrality, and analysis of the competition-cooperation relationship between bus and subway.
